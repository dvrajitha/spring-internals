2. My Java app started in 3 seconds—must be a bug.
3. I told my manager I'm full stack—now I'm debugging CSS.
4. "Works on my machine" is not a CI/CD strategy.
5. The only thing lazier than me is a Spring bean.
6. I used @Transactional to fix my relationship issues. Didn't work.
7. Coffee-powered since Java 1.0.
8. Spring Boot: turning monoliths into microservices one dependency at a time.
9. My code compiles—time to push to production!
10. Behind every successful `@Service` is a sleep-deprived developer.
